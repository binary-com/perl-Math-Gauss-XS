=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Math::Gauss::XS ':all';

  $p = pdf( $z );
  $p = pdf( $x, $m, $s );

  $c = cdf( $z );
  $c = cdf( $x, $m, $s );

  $z = inv_cdf( $z );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module just rewrites the L<Math::Gauss> module in XS. The precision and
exported function remain the same as in the original.

The benchmark results are

 Benchmark: timing 30000000 iterations of pp/pdf, xs/pdf...
    pp/pdf: 15 wallclock secs (14.99 usr +  0.00 sys = 14.99 CPU) @ 2001334.22/s (n=30000000)
    xs/pdf:  2 wallclock secs ( 2.16 usr +  0.00 sys =  2.16 CPU) @ 13888888.89/s (n=30000000)
 Benchmark: timing 30000000 iterations of pp/cdf, xs/cdf...
    pp/cdf: 40 wallclock secs (38.93 usr +  0.00 sys = 38.93 CPU) @ 770613.92/s (n=30000000)
    xs/cdf:  2 wallclock secs ( 2.22 usr +  0.00 sys =  2.22 CPU) @ 13513513.51/s (n=30000000)
 Benchmark: timing 30000000 iterations of pp/inv_cdf, xs/inv_cdf...
 pp/inv_cdf: 15 wallclock secs (16.02 usr +  0.00 sys = 16.02 CPU) @ 1872659.18/s (n=30000000)
